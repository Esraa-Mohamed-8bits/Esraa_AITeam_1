`Gamma`

*The Gamma function generalizes the factorial to real/complex numbers, acting as a crucial normalization constant in continuous probability distributions for positive random variables. It is essential for defining the Gamma, Exponential, Chi-Squared, and Beta distributions, which model waiting times, reliability, and Bayesian inference.*

**Key Distributions:**

- **Gamma Distribution:**

Often used for modeling waiting times (ex. time until the next event)

- **Chi-Squared Distribution:**

A special case of the Gamma distribution, vital for hypothesis testing

- **Exponential Distribution:**

A special case where n equals to 1

- **Beta Distribution:** 

Uses the Gamma function to define its normalization constant, commonly used in Bayesian statistics to model probabilities

**Applications:**

- **Modeling Waiting Times:** 

Calculating the probability of waiting less than a certain time for an event, such as in queueing theory or service times

- **Reliability Engineering:** 

Modeling the time until a component fails

- **Bayesian Inference:**

Serving as a prior distribution for the rate parameter of a Poisson process



`Hessian`

**The Hessian matrix is a square matrix of second-order partial derivatives that measures the local curvature of a function, crucial in AI for optimizing loss functions and analyzing model stability. It enables faster, second-order optimization (ex. Newton's method) by identifying the shape of the loss landscape, allowing for smarter, larger steps in flat regions and smaller steps in steep areas**

**Usage in AI & Machine Learning:**

- **Optimization:**

The Hessian helps navigate complex loss landscapes to find local minima, saddle points, or maxima

- **Faster Training:**

Newton's method uses the inverse Hessian to converge to a minimum in fewer iterations than gradient descent

- **Model Analysis:**

Used to measure curvature for sensitivity analysis, regularization, and understanding model convergence behavior

- **Robot Control:** 

Assists in calculating smooth, efficient motions by analyzing the curvature of motion functions

- **Computer Vision:** 

Used for identifying structure (ex. vessel/fissure localization) in images based on intensity curvature
